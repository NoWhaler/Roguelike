Overview
This Unity project explores the combination of different procedural generation algorithms to create diverse and engaging hex-based game maps. The game serves as a research platform for testing various generation techniques and their impact on gameplay dynamics.

üéØ Current Features
Procedural Map Generation

Multi-Algorithm Approach: Research implementation combining different procedural generation techniques
Hex-Based World: Complete hexagonal grid system for tactical gameplay
Chunk-Based Architecture: Map divided into distinct chunks, each with unique characteristics and properties

Core Gameplay Systems

Turn-Based Combat: Strategic turn-based movement and combat system
Unit Management: Build and recruit various unit types with different abilities
Building System: Construct and upgrade buildings with progression mechanics
Skill Tree: Comprehensive character/faction progression system

Technical Implementation

Dependency Injection: Clean architecture using Zenject framework
Design Patterns: Implementation of various software design patterns for maintainable code
